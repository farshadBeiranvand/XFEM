## Introduction
XFEM extends the Finite Element Method (FEM) to tackle complex geometries, material interfaces, and cracks without mesh refinement. It excels in modeling crack propagation, material interfaces, and heterogeneous materials accurately. This script explores XFEM's application in analyzing the mechanical behavior of graphene sheets, essential in nanotechnology. It considers non-local effects, offering insights into buckling and in-plane behavior for graphene-based structure design and optimization
## Features
- **Buckling Analysis**: Computes critical buckling loads and corresponding mode shapes.
- **In-Plane Behavior**: Analyzes stress distribution and deformation characteristics.
- **Non-Local Effects**: Accounts for non-local material behavior to capture size-dependent effects.
- **Crack Geometry**: Handles crack geometry and interactions with the structure.
- **Modular Structure**: Organized into modular sections for clarity and flexibility.

## Usage
**Setup**: Define plate properties, crack geometry, and material properties.
**Boundary Conditions**: Specify boundary conditions and applied loads.
**Run Analysis**: Execute the script to perform buckling and in-plane analysis.
**Visualization**: Visualize results, including mode shapes, stress distributions, and critical buckling loads.

## Getting Started
- Ensure MATLAB is installed on your system.
- Open the MATLAB script `_XFEM_Buckling_Analysis.m`.
